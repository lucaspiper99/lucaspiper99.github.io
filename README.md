## About Me

I'm an assistant researcher at INESC-ID and soon-to-be visiting student at Carnegie Mellon University. I am currently working at the intersection of neuroscience and computer vision, by using spatial frequency constraints from fMRI data to regularize computer vision models.

Previously, I was a master's student at Instituto Superior Técnico in Lisbon, where my thesis focused on developing a subcortical module for visual processing to improve model robustness to image perturbations while mirroring cortical representations.

## Work Experience

### Visiting Student @ Carnegie Mellon University (_November 2024 - December 2025_)
- Using spatial frequency constraints from fMRI data to regularize computer vision models.

### Research Assistant @ INESC-ID (_June 2024 - Present_)
- Developing robust computer vision systems by drawing inspiration from the early stages of the primate ventral stream.
- Enhancing standard backbone architectures with biologically inspired units to improve robustness against image corruptions, distribution shifts and adversarial attacks.
