## **About Me**

I am an assistant researcher at INESC-ID and a soon-to-be visiting student at the Psychology Department and Neuroscience Institute at Carnegie Mellon University. My work lies at the intersection of neuroscience and computer vision, where I use spatial frequency constraints derived from fMRI data to regularize computer vision models.

Previously, I was a master’s student in Computer Science and Engineering at Instituto Superior Técnico in Lisbon, where I specialized in Artificial Intelligence. My thesis focused on developing a subcortical module for visual processing to improve model robustness to image perturbations while mirroring cortical representations.
