## **About Me**

I'm an assistant researcher at INESC-ID and soon-to-be visiting student at Psychology Department and Neuroscience Institute at Carnegie Mellon University. I am currently working at the intersection of neuroscience and computer vision, by using spatial frequency constraints from fMRI data to regularize computer vision models.

Previously, I was a master's student at Instituto Superior Técnico in Lisbon, where my thesis focused on developing a subcortical module for visual processing to improve model robustness to image perturbations while mirroring cortical representations.
